#Generating Different types of distributions

How to generate a Normal distribution: 

Here we have generated a normal distribution having 20 data points selected randomly.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(20)
hist(x, col = 'steelblue')
abline(v = mean(x), lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```
How to generate a binomial distribution:
Here we have generated a 
```{r}
z<-rbinom( n = 100, size = 20, prob = 1/6 )

hist(z, col = 'steelblue')
```
Poisson Distribution
```{r}
y <- rpois(100, lambda = 1.2)
hist(y, col = 'steelblue')
abline(v = mean(y), lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```
Gamma Distribution
```{r}
x_dgamma <- seq(0, 2, by = 0.04)
y_dgamma <- dgamma(x_dgamma, shape = 6)
plot(y_dgamma)
```
mean as model
```{r}
z <- rnorm(50, mean = 5, sd = 2)
mean(z)
sd(z)
quantile(z)
quantile(z, 0.16)
mean(x) - sd(x)
mean(x) + sd(x)
```
Checking Normality of a distribution
```{r}
CompanyABCProfit<-read.csv("CompanyABCProfit.csv")
attach(CompanyABCProfit)
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggpubr")
library("ggpubr")
ggdensity(Profit,main="Profit per year", xlab="YEARLY PROFIT IN INR" )
ggqqplot(Profit)
ggplot(CompanyABCProfit) +     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Profit))
shapiro.test(Profit)
```
Generating a distribution and checking normality of the distribution
```{r}
N<- rnorm(100, mean=2, sd= 1.3 )
P <- rpois(100, lambda = 1.2)
#generate distribution z= p*N + (1-p)P
Y = 0.1*N
z= Y+P
#test Normality
shapiro.test(z) 
plot(z)
ggdensity(z)
ggqqplot(z)
```

```{r}
u=runif(40, min = -1, max = 1)
N<- rnorm(100, mean=2, sd= 1.3 )
#generate distribution z= p*N + (1-p)u where 0<p<1
s = 0.1*N
j=0.9*u
q= s+j
#test Normality
shapiro.test(q) 
plot(q)
ggdensity(q)
ggqqplot(q)
boxplot(q)
```
Emotional Valence Data
```{r}
# Load tidyverse and Warriner et al. (2013) data:

library(tidyverse)

war <- read_csv('warriner_2013_emotional_valence.csv')

# Check:

war

# Check valence measure range:

range(war$Val)

# Check the least and most positive wors:

filter(war, Val == min(Val) | Val == max(Val))

# Same thing, but more compact:

filter(war, Val %in% range(Val))

# Check tibble in ascending order:

arrange(war, Val)

# And descending order:

arrange(war, desc(Val))

#Mean and SD:

mean(war$Val)
sd(war$Val)

# 68% rule:

mean(war$Val) + sd(war$Val)
mean(war$Val) - sd(war$Val)

# Confirm:

quantile(war$Val, c(0.16, 0.84))

# Median:

median(war$Val)

# Which is the same as the 50th percentile:

quantile(war$Val, 0.5)
```

```{r}
ggdensity(war$Val)
boxplot(war$Val)
```
1. Generate an alpha distribution.
2. Generate a normal distribution with 150 data points and mean=2, standard deviation= 1.5 and a uniform distribution of maximum value 1, minimum value -1. Generate a distribution combining both using the equation, X= p*N + (p-1)u, where N= normal distribution, u= uniform distribution. X is generated new distribution. Vary the value of p= 1,2,3.. and check normality of distribution X. 
3. Load the emotional valence dataset from warrinar et al. 2013 check mean valence, plot boxplot with indication of first and third quantile value int it. Check normality of the data. 
```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
